# CQRS sample
This project aims to implement the basic CQRS principles.<br/>
Like any pattern, CQRS is useful in some places, but not in others. Many systems do fit a CRUD mental model, and so should be done in that style. CQRS is a significant mental leap for all concerned, so shouldn't be tackled unless the benefit is worth the jump.<br/>
So while CQRS is a pattern that's good to have in the toolbox, beware that it is difficult to use well and you can easily chop off important bits if you mishandle it. - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html<br/>
